        <h1>The Goal</h1>
        <p>To raise $1500 for the Canadian Easter Seals charity by September 1st. If successful, I will face my fear of heights to join the Drop Zone fundraising superheroes and rappel down the side of a downtown high rise.

        <h1>The Cause</h1>
        <p>For more than eighty-five years, Easter Seals, a registered charity, has been dedicated to serving Canadians with disabilities, striving to ensure that no one is left behind.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>More than 100,000 Canadians and their families annually access programs and services provided by Easter Seals organizations across Canada.</li>
            <li>Easter Seals provides summer camps and active living programs for Canadians with disabilities, as well as specialized mobility equipment</li>
            <li>Every summer, more than 6,000 kids attend one of Easter Seals' fully accessible summer camps</li>
          </ul>
        <p>At their fully accessible camps, kids and youth learn about themselves and the potential of their abilities. They are asked to get out of their comfort zones to overcome fears and try new things.</p>

        <h1>lorem2</h1>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
